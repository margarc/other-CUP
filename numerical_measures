variance = numerical measure of how the data values is dispersed around the mean. (SD)^2
var(datafile$dataset_wanted) 

standard deviation of an observation variable = the square root of its variance
sd(datafile$dataset_wanted)

covariance of two variables x and y in a data set measures how the two are linearly related. 
A positive covariance would indicate a positive linear relationship between the variables
A negative covariance = the opposite.

X <- datafile$variable_X
Y <- datafile$variable_Y
# execute:
cov(X, Y)


IQR = upper quartile - lower quartile
IQR(datafile$variable_wanted)

range = Largest value - smallest value 
duration <- dataset&of_test
# then execute
max(duration) − min(duration) 


Type II error = failure of rejecting an invalid null hypothesis (that should be rejected)
Power of a hypothesis test = the probability of avoiding the Type II error # POWER = 1 - β
