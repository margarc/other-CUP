variance = numerical measure of how the data values is dispersed around the mean. (SD)^2
var(datafile$dataset_wanted) 

standard deviation of an observation variable = the square root of its variance
sd(datafile$dataset_wanted)

covariance of two variables x and y in a data set measures how the two are linearly related. 
A positive covariance would indicate a positive linear relationship between the variables
A negative covariance = the opposite.

X <- datafile$variable_X
Y <- datafile$variable_Y
# execute:
cov(X, Y)
