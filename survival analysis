Survival analysis: To show and compare survival patterns.

In longitudinal studies in which there is a clear event from which the subjects are followed, such as diagnosis of a condition 
or treatment initiation, it might not be reasonable to assume that rates are constant, even for short periods of time. 
For example: risk of death is v.high right after heart surgery, it falls as the patient recovers and rises again over time.
