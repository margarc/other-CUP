Survival analysis: To show and compare survival patterns.

[From Chapter26, book: "Essential Medical Statistics" by Betty R. Kirkwood, Jonathan A. C. Sterne.]

In longitudinal studies in which there is a clear event from which the subjects are followed, such as diagnosis of a condition 
or treatment initiation, it might not be reasonable to assume that rates are constant, even for short periods of time. 
For example: risk of death is v.high right after heart surgery, it falls as the patient recovers and rises again over time. 

Survival analysis methods allow analysis of these rates without making assumption that they are constant.
Focus on:
1. Hazard: the instantaneous rate at time t 
2. Survivor function that is illustrated by the survival curve i.e. the prob that an individual will survive (will not experience 
the event of interest), up to and including time t.
