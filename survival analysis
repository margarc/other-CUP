Survival analysis: To show and compare survival patterns.

[From Chapter26, book: "Essential Medical Statistics" by Betty R. Kirkwood, Jonathan A. C. Sterne.]

In longitudinal studies in which there is a clear event from which the subjects are followed, such as diagnosis of a condition 
or treatment initiation, it might not be reasonable to assume that rates are constant, even for short periods of time. 
For example: risk of death is v.high right after heart surgery, it falls as the patient recovers and rises again over time. 

Survival analysis methods allow analysis of these rates without making assumption that they are constant.The assumption that hazards of 
event of interest are constant over the time period is avoided and instead the assumption is that: the RATIO of the HAZARDS in the two groups 
remains constant over the study period. 

In other words: The hazard in the exposed group at time t DIVIDED BY the hazard in the unexposed group at time t = constant 
This assumption is known as the PROPORTIONAL HAZARDS assumption

Focus on:
1. Hazard: the instantaneous rate at time t 
2. Survivor function that is illustrated by the survival curve i.e. the prob that an individual will survive (will not experience 
the event of interest), up to and including time t. 

Survival curve= known as a step function 
Curve = horizontal at all times at which there is no outcome event and each time an event of interest occurs, a vertical drop represents 
the change in the survivor function.
