# example from package "doseresmeta R"
# single study as follows:

data("cc_ex")
cc_ex
print(cc_ex, row.names = F, digits = 2)
mod.cc <- dosresmeta(formula = logrr~dose, type = "cc", cases = case, n = n, lb = lb, ub = ub, data = cc_ex)
# execute the following to see the result of the dose-res analysis:
summary(mod.cc)
# exponentiate the "estimate" to find the percentage:
exp(0.0454)
#result:  [1] 1.046446
# interpr: that every 1 gram/day increase in alcohol consumption is associated with a 4.6 % higher breast cancer risk
